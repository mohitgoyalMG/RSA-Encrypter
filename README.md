# RSA-Encrypter
Encrypter is an open source project for encryption and decryption of text.

It is based on RSA algorithm.
RSA is the most efficient algorithm for encryption and decryption of text which is used all over the world even by the Army.
It is a two key encryption technique which makes it reliable. Also till now no one have cracked this algorithm, this makes it reliable and safe.

The appplication is coded in JAVA language which gives it an advantage of becoming Platform Independent and more portable.

To run the project from the command line, download "RSA.jar" file and run the following command:

java -jar "RSA.jar"
